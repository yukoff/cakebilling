# huntgroups	This file defines the `huntgroups' that you have. A
#		huntgroup is defined by specifying the IP address of
#		the NAS and possibly a port range. Port can be identified
#		as just one port, or a range (from-to), and multiple ports
#		or ranges of ports must be seperated by a comma. For
#		example: 1,2,3-8
#
#		Matching is done while RADIUS scans the user file; if it
#		includes the selection criterium "Huntgroup-Name == XXX"
#		the huntgroup is looked up in this file to see if it
#		matches. There can be multiple definitions of the same
#		huntgroup; the first one that matches will be used.
#
#		This file can also be used to define restricted access
#		to certain huntgroups. The second and following lines
#		define the access restrictions (based on username and
#		UNIX usergroup) for the huntgroup.
